Crustless Vegetable Quiche

Makes one, 9-inch quiche

What You'll Need:

2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 small onion, diced
2 cups mushrooms, sliced (6-7 medium mushrooms)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 red pepper, diced
2 cups kale, center rib removed & shredded
4 large eggs
1 cup fat-free half & half
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
Salt
Fresh ground pepper

What to Do:

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch pie dish with cooking spray and set aside.
Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Let the onions cook until slightly translucent, but without browning, about 2-3 minutes.
Stir in mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook until their liquid has fully evaporated, 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add garlic and red pepper, and cook for 3 more minutes. Stir in kale, and continue to cook until kale begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk eggs until light and fluffy. Whisk in the half and half, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
Add the cooked vegetables to the pie dish. Top with egg mixture.
Bake 30-35 minutes, until edges and light golden and the center remains slightly jiggly.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
