Mini Veggie Frittatas

Ingredients
4 eggs
3/4 cup egg whites
1/2 cup milk or milk alternative
2 tsp shredded fresh basil
1 tsp fresh dill, finely chopped
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup loosely packed shredded spinach
1 tsp smoked paprika
dash of sea salt and black pepper
3/4 cup mixed diced bell peppers
½ cup diced yellow onion
½ cup low fat mozzarella cheese (optional)
 
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly spray 8 cups of a muffin tray with an oil mister or non-stick cooking spray.
In a bowl, whisk eggs, egg whites, milk, fresh herbs, spinach, paprika, sea salt and black pepper until well combined.
Mist a small frying pan with oil and set heat to medium. Lightly sautee the diced onion and bell peppers for about 2 minutes or until they just begin to soften. Remove the pan from the heat.
Divide the vegetable mixture evenly between 8 cups in your muffin pan, followed by the egg mixture. (They will be very full!) Bake for 15 min.
If using cheese, remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle it on top of each mini quiche. Place the pan back in the oven and cook for another 10 minutes or until eggs have set completely.
Remove the pan from the oven and allow it to cool slightly. Slide the blade of a knife around the edge of each quiche to loosen them, then carefully lift them out of the pan. Serve immediately.
