I've realized that starting the day off on the right foot is crucial: If I don't start off with a healthy, filling meal, the rest of the day is basically a wash. Still, even knowing this, it can be pretty hard to drag myself out of bed on a work day to make a good breakfast.

To combat laziness and keep my days on track, I've been making a healthy breakfast with several servings early in the week, then popping each serving in the microwave before heading out to face the day. This quinoa breakfast bake is a perfect example of how to do it right. Tip: Mix the flavors up by adding whatever fruit and nuts you like best!

Serves 4-6

What You'll Need: 

1 cup quinoa (uncooked)
2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon allspice 2 eggs
2 cups skim milk 1/4 cup maple syrup 1 1/2 cups frozen berries
1 apple or pear, peeled, cored, and chopped into 1/2 inch cubes
1/2 cup coarsely chopped nuts (optional)
What to Do: 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease an 8x8 inch square baking pan, and set aside. (Note: a 9x11 works fine, too!)
In a medium bowl, stir together uncooked quinoa, cinnamon, and allspice to coat quinoa with spices. Pour quinoa over bottom of prepared pan.
In the same bowl used for the quinoa, beat the eggs until fully mixed. Whisk in the milk and maple syrup, and beat to combine.
Scatter the berries, apple or pear pieces, and nuts (if using) evenly on top of the quinoa.
Pour the egg and milk mixture over the top of the fruit and quinoa. Lightly stir to partially submerge the fruit. (The milk mixture will cook the quinoa to create a very soft texture on the inside, while creating a lightly crunchy crust on the outside!)
Bake for 1 hour, or until casserole is mostly set with only a small amount of liquid left. Serve warm, and refrigerate leftovers.
